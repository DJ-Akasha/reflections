When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Definitely when collaborating with others or when asking for help from others
    so that they can see the full context of the code. Also when creating something
    that could be useful to others and turning it into something that is open source.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You could potentially be making a large change that you wouldn't want your 
    collaborators to see until after you had verified that it works.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are only used in the context of GitHub and are essentially like cloning. 
	Clones are copies of repositories or directories. Branches are part of the same
	repository as everything else in the repo. They are used for organising code
	when two or more versions of the code need to be different for example, one 
	branch is for adding a new feature that the developer isn't sure will actually
	work.
